I recently graduated with a degree in Software Engineering üéì.

In the past I‚Äôve worked on mobile development, big data, web development, and data structures & algorithms.
During my internship at Accenture, I worked as a backend developer using AWS and Python to process data.
Most recently, I was an intern at ING as a Front-end Developer, where I worked with Lit, JavaScript, and modern front-end tools.

I‚Äôm now looking for opportunities as a Software Engineer to apply my skills and keep growing. üöÄ
