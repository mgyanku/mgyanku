# Hello üëã, I'm Miriam!

I'm currently in my senior year of my Software Engineering degree working towards my graduation.
I have learned about many different areas of IT during my degree, and now I am looking for an
internship to focus on and gain more experience.

In the past I've delved into mobile development, big data, web development and data structures & algorithms.
In my past internship at Accenture I worked as a backend developer, 
where I worked with AWS and Python to process data.

- üí≠ Currently working on a sport facility booking website.
- üå± Currently learning about Angular.
- ‚≠ê Fun fact: I like to listen to jazz when i'm programming!
